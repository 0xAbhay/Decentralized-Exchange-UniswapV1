# Decentralized Exchange on Ethereum Sepolia Testnet

This project is a decentralized exchange (DEX) deployed on the Ethereum Sepolia testnet. The DEX contract can be found at the following address: `0x39ade831179C387cAB4256FE5Ba76F13e8E21D54`.

## Overview

The decentralized exchange allows users to perform various actions such as swapping tokens, adding liquidity, and withdrawing liquidity. It is designed to function similarly to Uniswap V1, providing a user-friendly and efficient trading experience.

## Features

1. **Swap Tokens**: Users can easily swap tokens directly on the DEX. This feature enables quick and seamless token exchanges without the need for an intermediary.

2. **Add Liquidity**: Users can provide liquidity to the DEX by depositing their tokens into the liquidity pool. This allows other users to trade against the provided liquidity and ensures a liquid market.

3. **Withdraw Liquidity**: Users who have added liquidity to the DEX can withdraw their funds at any time. This feature gives users the flexibility to manage their liquidity as they see fit.
